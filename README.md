# Economic-diversification-indicators
This repository contains the estimation of the main diversification (or inequality) indicators: Theil, Gini and HHI.


The database used was created from estimates of value added in final demand (VAFD), using the ICIO tables.

Note: the results have been validated. Anyway, use with caution. Any suggestions for improvement can be sent to me at dffjs98@gmail.com.
